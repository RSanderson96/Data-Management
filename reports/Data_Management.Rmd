## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# **An Evaluation of the Use of Video**

Since the third cycle of the course, videos have been used as an educational method. The data collected has considered the video duration, total views and viewer location amongst other factors. It is important to reflect on the use of this method, and whether there is a high uptake by students to make them a worthwhile educational tool

##**The data itself**
Initially, the data was considered through 5 datasets, for each run of the course that used videos.

##**Data Preparation**
The final dataset was constructed within a singular dataframe, as is seen below

This dataframe allowed a clear comparison across the datasets, to inform the temporal analysis of the use of videos within the educational course.

``` {R Views_Dataframe}

Video.3.Device.Usage

```

##**The Findings**

The findings can be visualised below
